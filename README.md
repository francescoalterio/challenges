# Challenges
Repository of programming challenges and their different solutions in a variety of languages.  The goal of the repository is to learn, practice and improve programming languages, data structures, algorithms, etc. In a fun and challenging way.

## Organization

Each exercise has its own folder, inside each folder there is a README.md which contains the description of the exercise to be performed and mostly examples of it. Additionally, you will find folders divided by programming languages which have solutions to the exercise in said language which have been solved by me.
